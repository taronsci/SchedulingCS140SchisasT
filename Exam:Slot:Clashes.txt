For file "ear-f-83.crs" 4 slots, 1 iteration, 4 shifts we get 0 clashes at step 1.


For file "kfu-s-93.crs":
The conclusion is that there is not enough appropriate training data to reach a state of 0 clashes using a Hopfield Network

/* Easy to see that 1 slot is not enough to solve the problem. */

    For 2 slots:
/*
The system reaches min clash state (8 clashes) at step 1 when shift is 2.
When shift is 1, min clashes are 10.
*/
Shift = 1	Min clashes = 10	at step 3
0 372 0
1 89 10

Shift = 2	Min clashes = 8	at step 1
0 357 8
1 104 0

    For 3-19 slots:
/*
The system will reach the min clash state (2 clashes) in one iteration, given the number of shifts is greater than or equal to 3.
In this case, when increasing the shift the two problematic courses(11, 13) move to the next slot together.
Everything else remains exactly the same. When setting shift to the max (number of slots), the two move to slot 0.
The courses clashing with the two move to slot 1.
